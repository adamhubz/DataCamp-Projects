# Who's Tweeting? Trump or Trudeau?
**Python projects on DataCamp**

Build a machine learning classifier that knows whether President Trump or Prime Minister Trudeau is tweeting!

## Project Description
Let's apply our natural language processing knowledge to Twitter. Tweets are notoriously difficult, as they are shorter than most texts and usually have hard-to-parse content like hashtags, mentions, links and emoji.

Despite the difficulties, tweets are fun content, so in this notebook we'll take a look at classifying two prominent North American politicians. Can we determine if it is Donald Trump or Justin Trudeau based on just a tweet? Let's see!
